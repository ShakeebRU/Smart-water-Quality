# Smart-water-Quality
There are many different systems available like our project, but they all have different problems i.e.,
using less sensors, not predicting or forecasting the water quality check, and many more. So,
because of all those problems we develop a project which will utilize the internet of things (IOT),
which enables real-time monitoring of water quality through use of five sensors 
that integrate drinking water quality measurements such as PH, temperature, turbidity, 
TDS, and a water flow sensor for drinking a system based on IoT and machine learning.
We developed this project as a whole package. 

This project will contain Gathering live data from sensors, collected data transfer to firebase using Arduino 
and Wi-Fi -module, live readings shown on app and prediction done on collected data using machine learning algorithm LSTM using Flask API.
